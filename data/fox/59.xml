They note a comparable lot recently fetched $60 million. With the mansion’s history a buyer could be found for $80 to $90 million.There’s just one caveat.The lucky buyer is going to have give Hefner a life estate that would allow him to live there until he dies, TMZ reported.The website also reported that prospective buyers will be able to tour the property except for one part of the house that will  be off-limits: the pajama-clad Hef’s palatial bedroom.
