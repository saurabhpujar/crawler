	Dana Perino: Try a 'political cleanse' in 2016
</title>
<description>
	The new year is a time for reflection and restoration, a chance to hit your own personal reset button. I was grateful for some time with family and friends (and Jasper, my dog, of course), and I tried something new: a political cleanse.  For more than a week, I made only passing glances at the political news of the day and avoided conversations about the election year. On rare occasions, I cheated and dove into a discussion but only with people who fully agreed with me. It was like eating a chocolate cupcake — I got the high sugar rush but then felt the low as it wore off, so I hopped back on the abstention wagon.  The health benefits of a political cleanse include:    - Restoring balance - Preventing wrinkles - Improving digestion - Reducing neck and shoulder tension - Sharpening focus - Clearing the mind - Lowering blood pressure - Lightening my mood - Lifting my spirits  I’m grateful for time I had to refresh my mind and body, and now I’m back to my daily dose of politics. To remember how good I felt for a week, I’m going to keep the idea of a political cleanse taped to my refrigerator.
