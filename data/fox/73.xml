	Madonna tearfully addresses 'challenging times' amid custody battle
</title>
<description>
	Madonna breaks down!The 57-year-old fought back tears on Wednesday during a performance in Mexico City, opening up about facing a "challenging" time in her life."We all go through challenging times in our life.. And that includes me. I too go through challenging times in my life, right now is one of them," she confessed. "Sometimes I feel I can't do a show. I don't have the energy, I don't have the strength."After pausing to wipe away tears, Madge continued: "I came out here tonight and can see your faces, and I look into your eyes, and I see so much love and you give me strength. So, thank you." Â The singer is currently engaged in a highly-publicized custody battle with ex-husband Guy Ritchie over the former couple's 15-year-old son, Rocco. Her Wednesday performance marked the first new show on her Rebel Heart Tour after a 10-week hiatus.Rocco had previously been on the road with his mother, but reportedly wanted to continue living with his father in London. Last month, a Manhattan Supreme Court judge reportedly ordered the teen to return to New York before school resumed again after the holiday break.Meanwhile, Madonna's tour will continue on throughout the month of January until wrapping on Jan. 28 in Puerto Rico.Through all the legal drama, Madonna continues to show love for her children on her Instagram account.Rousey in just bodypaintModel takes a standShould this ad be banned?Woman has longest legs in USHalsey's hottest pics
