<description>
	
A British pilot has arrived in Sydney in Australia - more than three months after setting off from Farnborough, Hampshire, in the UK in a vintage bi-plane.  
Tracey Curtis-Taylor wanted to retrace the journey made by Amy Johnson in 1930.  
During her epic flight, she made 50 refuelling stops and covered 14,600 miles, flying over 23 countries.
