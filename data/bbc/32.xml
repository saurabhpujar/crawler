The Berchtesgaden Salt Mine opened 1517 and is now a popular destination for tourists.
And some believe the mine has magical powers and a healing energy. Deep inside the mine is a salt cure gallery.
Past visitors are said to have seen improvements in a range of conditions including hay fever, depression, asthma and insomnia.
Rajan Datar booked himself in for a night.
