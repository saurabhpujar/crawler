	FA Cup: Man Utd 0-0 Sheff Utd
</title>
<description>
	
Saqueeb Rajan: It's great to have Chris 'Pele' Smalling in defence but we need a Pele upfront scoring goals!! #MUFC #bbcfacup.
Shah Iftekhar: #bbcfacup Why is Marouane Fellaini playing? He just ruins the team.
"We haven't had a chance here yet and it's not been very good."
Juan Mata will race onto Chris Smalling's long pass... no he won't, the greasy surface skips the ball through.
Sheffield United look well set as play builds again, a good shape with two banks of four facing their hosts - "come and beat us" it screams.
Can Matteo Darmian find any joy down the right flank? He's held off by Jay McEveley and goalkeeper George Long has the ball in his hands.
"This Sheffield United team are huge, especially Conor Sammon - he looks like a monster."
Press Association's Paul Hirst is one of those battling the elements at Old Trafford.
Rain pouring down here at Old Trafford. Pitch as greasy as the chip butty the SUFC fans are singing about.
Sheffield United are going to have to live off scraps it seems. Very little in terms of scary moments for them so far though. 
They are isolating Wayne Rooney admirably - just eight touches for him - though they'll want Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ander Herrera to see less ball. The pair have more touches than anyone else. Herrara with 35 touches, his fellow midfielder with 33.
Sheffield United corner comes in fizzed to the near post... Marouane Fellaini gets up and scrapes his head on the moon to clear. Some leap, good defensive header.
"It was a lovely weight of pass from Matteo Darmian behind the left back.
"Wayne Rooney does everything right going round the keeper but he can't find the ball to Juan Mata and it's good defending by Sheff Utd to recover."
Lovely vision from Matteo Darmian at right-back, hes picked out Wayne Rooney who ROUNDS THE KEEPER. Forced wide, can Rooney find a man in the box... no. Some good rush-defending by the League One side. They lived dangerously there.
Conor Sammon briefly prompts a collective intake of breath at Old Trafford as his volley needs a tip over. There was a handball in the build-up though. At the other end, Wayne Rooney has a lash and the ball settles high into the crowd behind the goal.
"It's up to Man Utd to break down this team, they've got to stretch them.
"Anthony Martial has gone down the middle now and I think that's the best place for him tonight with his pace.
"But Sheff Utd are doing a great job defensively, they're organised and well-drilled."
Whack. A beast of a tackle on the edge of the box from David Edgar. He shouts at the man on the floor to get up. That was a traditional FA Cup tackle, all that was missing is a muddy pitch.
Some 105 passes by Manchester United so far, just 37 for the visitors. Bastian Schweinsteiger has seen more ball than anyone else but there's nothing penetrating coming just yet. Can Anthony Martial swivel on the edge of the box? No, forced backwards and a throw is all the home side can earn.
"It's just two years since a League One side reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup and that was Sheffield United.
"That was a great run. This is a big club, they're the big timers in League One."
Chris Waddle: "They're definitely the scalp everyone wants in that league."
Plenty of possession and more importantly territory for Manchester United but nothing too threatening arriving. Marouane Fellaini threatens to leap into orbit at the back post as a corner comes in but his header loops into the goalmouth and gets hacked away.
Manchester United are stroking the ball about nicely but not breaking through the closed ranks of the Blades yet. Juan Mata tries to bend a ball over the line of defenders but Anthony Martial can't get on the end of it.
"Sheffield United have started with a terrific tempo and they're really working hard - let's see if they can keep it up. 
"But Man United aren't trying to get in behind, Wayne Rooney is looking for the ball in to feet and if you want any joy against this Sheffield United team you've got to stretch them."
Sheffield United are looking to get in behind the hosts' full-backs and it takes some good defensive play from Daley Blind and Bastian Schweinsteiger to defuse a threatening situation down their left. A lively start.
Let's get a good win today, lads! Love the FA Cup 🏆 #MUFC
"Sheffield United have got the likes of Matt Done, Jose Baxter and Che Adams who are all good, tricky players.
"But the real worry for the Blades is that they've got no pace in defence to cope if United play a quick game." 
Those travelling hoards from Sheffield are noisy. It's actually a surprise that the Blades are in white shirts with red shorts as opposed to Manchester United in red shirts and white shorts. All a bit confusing.
Referee Jon Moss has replaced Andre Marriner for this tie, because of injury, and he hosts the coin toss in the centre circle of a very wet Old Trafford. It's tipping it down.
Let's play.
Sheffield United's own record in recent seasons isn't too shabby either...
Against higher-ranked opponents, the League One side have won five of their last six ties.
Louis van Gaal is pulled to one side in the tunnel by a steward. It looks like he's being asked if he's trodden on something and walked it into the carpet. Surely not.
 Luke Blakeley: Feeling nervous about #MUFCvSUFC. We're a poor team out of form and anything can happen in the Cup. Hope LVG has a plan.
Old Trafford is nice and full, rocking to the a Stone Roses mix. Nice.
This is no ordinary match programme
It contains the biggest hint yet that Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is looking to sign players in January.
Van Gaal writes he would strengthen "if the opportunity does arise" and he and his coaches feel "something can be done".
But he adds: "I don't see January as the ideal time to do business."
Nigel Adkins never got the chance to manage at Old Trafford during his days with Southampton.
The 50-year-old was dismissed weeks prior to the Saints visiting today's hosts in 2013 and though he admits he wishes Sir Alex Ferguson was still in the opposing dug-out, his excitement is evident.
"It will be a privilege to meet a coach as successful as Louis van Gaal and when I look out I'll see Sir Alex's name on the opposite stand," he says. "That's good enough for me. I'll know I have arrived then."
BBC Get Inspired has again teamed up with the Football Association to launch the 2016 FA People's Cup, a free five-a-side knock-out competition that gives the people of England the chance to play in their version of the FA Cup.
Here's the appropriately-named 'Prizehunters' lifting last year's adult men's trophy with FA Cup winner Joe Royle.
You’ve got just under a week to go to get involved. Entries – for individuals or teams – close at midnight on Friday, 15 January.
There are 10 categories from under-14 to Over-50s walking football and disability. You can find out all about it here.
Now, if you read our opening entry you will be forgiven for quickly searching for and listening to Manchester United's 1994 hit "Come on you Reds"
It reached number one in the UK charts, trouncing Chelsea's "No one can stop us now" effort which was reached 23 as the two clubs prepared for the cup final.
Remarkably, that is the last FA Cup song to reach number one.
So Liverpool's 'Pass and Move' and Cardiff's 'Bluebirds flying high' are just two examples of efforts which haven't cut the mustard in the years since.
What chance a tune from the Red Devils come May?
Awesome seats #MUvsSU #bbcfacup 
Past FA Cup history between these two sides? There is a bit.
Manchester United have played Sheffield United on four previous occasions in the FA Cup, with United the visitors in each fixture (W3 L1).
They faced each other in three successive seasons in the cup between 1993 and 1995, with the Blades beating their opponents in the first of these duels before bowing out in third round ties in each of the following campaigns.

Man Utd v The First United, FA Cup 3rd Round. COYRAWW!!!!! #twitterblades #sufc #FACup #bbcfacup 
Louis van Gaal was at it again during his news conference this week, confusing the names of his players with the frequency of a London tube.
After mixing up striker Will Keane with sold defender Michael Keane, he turned to the complex name of Chris Smalling, a player he has previously called Mike.
"I said to 'Mike' Smalling that I call him Pele because he had a fantastic move so it is easier to call him Pele now," said Van Gaal.
So Chris Smalling is called Pele it seems. I'm sure he'll take that all day long.
Man Utd: De Gea, Darmian, Smalling, Blind, Borthwick-Jackson, Fellaini, Schweinsteiger, Mata, Ander Herrera, Martial, Rooney. Subs: Depay, Romero, Varela, McNair, Lingard, Andreas Pereira, Keane.
Sheff Utd: Long, Brayford, Edgar, Collins, McEveley, Coutts, Basham, Hammond, Woolford, Sammon, Sharp. Subs: Howard, Flynn, Baxter, Done, Campbell-Ryce, Reed, Adams.
Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands)
Managed by the most positive man on earth, Sheffield United may well fancy this one then.
Nigel Adkins could make a a stone statue smile. His zest and constantly upbeat persona will no doubt ready a team which will lap up this nothing-to-lose scenario.
"On paper we have no chance but we all know the FA Cup does not always work like that,” says Adkins.
That's the spirit Nigel. Now let's see who's got what.
Anyone remember those prolific Manchester United FA Cup finals songs in the charts in the '90s?
"Come on you Reds" was a 1994 classic, "We're gonna do it again" a 1995 hit.
As hard as it may be to believe, it's approaching 12 years since the Red Devils last won England's famous cup competition. Unthinkable.
