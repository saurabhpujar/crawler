Mexican drug lord Joaquin ''El Chapo'' Guzman has been recaptured, six months after he escaped from a maximum-security jail.
Guzman escaped from jail through a 1.5km (mile) long tunnel dug in the showers, sparking a huge manhunt, with a $5m (Â£3.2m) reward for information offered by the US government.
He was apprehended following a shoot-out with Mexican marines in Los Mochis, a coastal city in his home state of Sinaloa, north-west Mexico, an official told the Associated Press.
Katy Watson reports from Mexico City.
