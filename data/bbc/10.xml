	FA Cup third round reaction
</title>
<description>
	
Another bit of transfer news, this time in the Championship, with Ipswich Town boss Mick McCarthy confirming that full-back Jonathan Parr is joining Norway's Stromsgodset.
I've not forgotten that there's a game on by the way - it's just that nothing has happened at Old Trafford apart from some very strong weather.

Follow that game in more detail here...

Speaking of January moves, Bournemouth have moved close to signing Wolves striker Benik Afobe after the clubs agreed a fee.
Wolves say they "were left with little other option than to reluctantly accept the substantial bid. 
"Benik leaves Wolves with the Club’s best wishes for the future."
Steve Evans says Leeds have received combined offers of over £30million for some of his players. #lufc
Mixed fortunes for teams in League Two this weekend.
Wycombe and Exeter have both banked money-spinning replays at Premier League giants, while Northampton have booked a, er, whatever the opposite of money-spinning replay is at local side MK Dons.

Catch up with all of the results, reaction and highlights here.

The worst goal-kick of the day, brutally punished by Jon Walters.
I preferred it when Newcastle didn't try in the Cups. At least then we had an excuse! #NUFC #CupsandTop8 #EmiratesFACup 🙈
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "It was a good cup tie. Doncaster played well with a good quality of ball into our box, and we had to defend manfully at times.
"It was two great goals that won us the tie and we're delighted with that. We made a lot of changes and we weren't as fluent as we know we can be, but the guys that came in did well. A number of them haven't had games for a number of weeks so I was really pleased with what they put up today."
FA cup dreams in the bin for #BrentfordFC after a rubbish performance. #bbcfacup 
congrats to @Jakobhaugaard on his first start, well deserved and a very solid performance, to go with a good win! @stokecity #FACup
Doncaster manager Darren Ferguson: "I thought our performance was good. We were really unlucky not to get something out of that game.
"We worked very hard and if we play like that every week we will win games. We've had a couple of clear chances at the end with Nathan Tyson and Andy Butler but in the cups you don't get a second chance and you have to take them.
"We should have had a penalty at 1-1 and Wollscheid could have been sent off. We felt the little decisions didn't go our way."
Dagenham manager John Still, nine days into his third spell, said: "I’ve not been back too long but the work we’ve been doing has helped us compete.
"The game plan was good and everyone has worked well. It’s a good day to be a manager of this club.
"We’ve had a disappointing first half of the season but everyone has worked so hard, including the former manager Wayne Burnett, who’s my mate. This performance was for him."
Norwich boss Alex Neil: "In the first half, we didn't retain ball well enough and good teams will punish you. 
"We played better in the second half but the damage had already been done. 
"You can give Sergio Aguero credit but we should have defended better. 
"We will forget this game as of now. Our bread and butter is the league."
Everton manager Roberto Martinez was asked if the cat on the pitch this afternoon could be a good omen: "Hopefully. I thought he had great style and movement."   
Some more from Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: "We've been linked with a couple of defenders, there'll be no defenders coming to this football club.
 "We've been linked with a couple of midfielders, there'll be no midfielders coming to this football club.
"We will be looking for an offensive player, a striker-type player. Hopefully we can get someone in before the end of January."
Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: "This is what this team's about. We're difficult to score against with a good back four and goalkeeper. We can kill teams on the break.
 "We have a great resilience. You look at our record of teams scoring an equaliser, we go on to win more than we lose.
"Looking at the results today I'd say we've had the best result of the FA Cup this weekend."
Under way at Old Trafford.

Joel Campbell scored a fine goal as Arsenal marched on into round four. It's three years since Arsenal lost an FA Cup tie...
Everton manager Roberto Martinez: "It was very satisfying. There’s no such thing as easy tie and know these games are testing you have to concentrate. Dagenham showed that, they kept their shape well and it's easy to get exposed.
"I was pleased with the attacking threat but you have to give them credit for the way they defended. I was impressed with the physical levels of Dagenham.
 "It was good to see Phil Jagielka get 90 minutes, and Bryan Ovidedo get 90 minutes, and Steven Pienaar was able to feel like a footballer again."
Bolton manager Neil Lennon says: "We showed everything that we wanted to do - great character. Full credit to Eastleigh, they played very well but the pitch was a great leveller. We kept going and it's a cup tie so anything can happen. I've been on the end of a couple of giant-killings and it was not going to be easy.
"You couldn't play down both sides as the pitch was really heavy and it was a case of missing out the midfield. I've not seen a pitch as bad as that for a long time, but we wanted the game to go ahead.
"It was a classic third-round story but we negotiated one part and now have to negotiate the other part. It hasn't been an easy time for the football club and we could be losing two very important players for us due to the financial constraints.
"But we're still a football club and we still have a beating heart. This shows there is still life in this club."
"Newcastle going out was to be expected really - Watford are so strong and powerful at home.
"Newcastle just don't create enough chances and scoring goals continues to be a big problem for them."
The lights are on, the rain comes down, the players are out for the late game.

Follow that match in full here.

"It was heartbreaking for Bristol City with the equaliser coming so late into injury time.
"There was no really big shocks today even though Eastleigh and Bristol City came so close.
"But at least they've both got replays and can say they're in the draw for the next round."
"Arsenal are the favourites for the FA Cup again. It's another good solid performance, they are top of the league as well and it's all looking rosy for Arsene Wenger."
Could Arsenal win it three years in a row?
Some more quotes from Eastleigh manager Chris Todd.
He says: "It has been a very special day for the football club and there was definitely a special performance. We deserved to win so it's a credit to the players.
"We're the National League team, they are the Championship side, three divisions above us, but I heard shouts from their bench saying 'get it in the corner'.
"The conditions were very difficult, but we played some great football, some lovely stuff. It was a great cup tie and for us financially it is going to be a bonus. We're full of beans and looking forward to the replay."
"You've got to fancy Manchester United at home. But we've seen them too often this season and have been disappointed"

What a goal!
Sergio Aguero turned on the style to put Manchester City ahead at Carrow Road early on. 
"Arsenal scored some fantastic goals throughout the game and remarkably Arsene Wenger has still never gone out in the third round.
"He's never had that shock or giant-killing and they've had some tough draws.
"Arsenal just got better and better as the game went on and scored great footballing goals with plenty of one-twos and clinical finishes."
Eastleigh manager Chris Todd on Final Score
"It's quite emotional, the players have put in an unbelievable performance and we probably deserved to win the game.
"But we're still in the draw for the fourth round so we're happy overall.
"We've played on pitches like this in the league this season - credit to the referee for getting the game on when some might have called it off.
"The crowd here shows it's possible to draw support in this area - the owner has ambitions of getting to the Championship and I just think he might."
Nick Robertson: Performance of real gut and determination. So proud of the blues today @wwfcofficial #WWFCvAVFC #bbcfacup #wwfc.
Dean Bennell: WE'RE GOING TO WEMMMBBBLLEEEEYY #colu #colchester #bbcfacup #charlton #facup #cupset.
Euan Zaha Wilson: Love a cup run! Great win for Crystal Palace beating Southampton away AGAIN! Avoid a Premier League team in the next round please #CPFC #FACup #bbcfacup.
Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: "It was a very good performance. From the beginning we were very aggressive
"I said last week the way Sergio Aguero started playing and the more minutes he plays he always improves his performance. He scored a beautiful goal.
"It's very important to be focused game-by-game. 
"One of the merits of this squad is to be involved in all the competitions with the injuries that we have had."
"Andy Butler and Nathan Tyson both had late chances to level the game for Doncaster. Andy Butler missed a header from four yards out, if he had just headed it down it's a goal."
"Saying that, Stoke did a good job, they weathered the storm and it was a great strike by Jon Walters to win the game." 
"Bolton dug in and they kept throwing balls into the box and in the end it came from a corner.
"Maybe it was a lack of fitness or concentration from Eastleigh but Darren Pratley was able to nick a goal.
"If you'd told Eastleigh at the start of the day they've get a replay then they'd have snapped your hand off.
"With the way the game went they'll be disappointed not to win but at least they're in the draw for the fourth round."
Not a third round full of shocks at the moment.
Premier League West Brom spared their blushes with an injury-time leveller against Championship strugglers Bristol City, while non-league Eastleigh lost the lead to draw 1-1 at home to Championship Bolton.
Second-tier Preston were dumped out 2-0 by League One Peterborough, while League One Colchester beat Championship Charlton 2-1.
Another suprise came at Championship Brentford, where League One Walsall were 1-0 victors 
Eastleigh were dreaming of a place in round four when Dorian Dervite put through his own goal...
...only for Bolton to scramble a late leveller.
Simon Jeavons: Usual FA Cup brilliance today, can't beat it. Hoping no cupset at Old Trafford later #bbcfacup.
Michael Blighe: Well the north-east suffered badly today. As a Newcastle fan, I'm disappointed in all of those defeats. #bbcfacup.
A confirmed list of today's winners then:
Arsenal 3-1 Sunderland
Birmingham 1-2 Bournemouth
Brentford 0-1 Walsall
Colchester 2-1 Charlton
Doncaster 1-2 Stoke
Everton 2-0 Dag & Red
Hartlepool 1-2 Derby
Hull 1-0 Brighton

Middlesbrough 1-2 Burnley
Norwich 0-3 Man City
Peterborough 2-0 Preston
Sheff Wed 2-1 Fulham
Southampton 1-2 Crystal Palace
Watford 1-0 Newcastle
West Ham 1-0 Wolves
"Eastleigh's Josh Flitney was pulling off save after save and I think the pressure just told in the end. On a pitch that wasn't suited to great football, I think the draw was a fair result."
Exeter 2-2 Liverpool (Friday)
Wycombe 1-1 Aston Villa 
Bury 0-0 Bradford  
Eastleigh 1-1 Bolton  
Huddersfield 2-2 Reading

Mesut rounds off a busy day of tweeting in the stands.
Well deserved victory, Gunners! 👍👌 Next round 💪 #FACup #COYG #AFCvSFC
Hull City move into the fourth round of the FA Cup thanks to a 1-0 win over fellow Championship side Brighton.
Robert Snodgrass converted a first-half penalty after Lewis Dunk fouled Hull midfielder Harry Maguire before Steve Bruce's side missed numerous chances to double their lead.
That nearly came back to haunt them in the third minute of injury-time as Andrew Crofts, with only Brighton's second shot of the match, hit the crossbar from Kazenga LuaLua's cross.
Daniel Woodley: ANOTHER defeat for @SouthamptonFC. That's eight in their last 10 games. Changes needed surely? #bbcfacup.
David Holt: #Eastleigh had the chances to put #Bolton away but didn't take them. Can feel slightly hard done by #bbcfacup.
Craig Smith: #Arsenal scrape through, winning 3-1 against #Sunderland. So pretty much exactly the same game as five weeks ago. #bbcfootball.
"Arsenal were worried for two-thirds of this game before eventually going through. If only Steven Fletcher's header had have gone in instead of hitting the crossbar at 1-1."
"These two are only 15 miles apart so don't have far to travel for the replay. Northampton did actually have pressure late on, but MK Dons held out."
Eastleigh goalkeeper Ross Flitney on Final Score:
"I really did think we were going to hang on - we've worked so hard to prepare this week for the game on a difficult pitch for both teams. It looks like a cow field.
"It was an old mate of mine Darren Pratley who got the equaliser, which hurts a bit more.
"But this is what the FA Cup is all about - anything can happen and it almost did."
It took a while to seal victory but Everton were always in control of their on destiny. They missed chances before Arouna Kone got his first goal. Dagenham and Redbridge had limited ambition in the final third and take the money before attempting to stay in the Football League.
Forest are through after an uninspiring cup tie at the City Ground.
Forest were on top in the first half, QPR had the better of things after the break without creating much. Jamie Ward grabbed the goal in a game that won't live long in the memory.
Dagenham boss John Still gets all of his squad into a huddle and there's plenty of pride on display after that performance from his League Two side.
"A tremendous performance from Bristol City, they were robbed by an equaliser goal in the last minute. The four minutes of added on time proved crucial but City did their fans proud."
A brave effort by a Bristol City side who didn't have enough players to field a full substitutes bench.
West Brom's injury-time leveller avoids the shock of the day.
"What a wonderful game of football but Eastleigh will be kicking themselves. They won't get a better chance to go through. Three gilt-edged chances which they could not take. yo  could see and feel the deflation when Bolton's equaliser went in."
Another disappointing afternoon for Southampton.
Darren Bent ensures there is no FA Cup embarrassment for Derby head coach Paul Clement, grabbing the winner as the Rams come from behind to edge out Hartlepool.
Eastleigh so close to a famous win. But now a lucrative (?) replay for both sides...
"It was too simple for Man City today - I was expecting Norwich to put on a better show.
"But that first goal from Sergio Aguero was exceptional - he beats three or four defenders before finishing. It was worthy of Lionel Messi."
 Heartbreak for Championship Bristol City as James Morrison levels for Premeir League West Brom.
The holders are through.
Next.
What a chance! Andy Butler again, heads over from four yards out...
