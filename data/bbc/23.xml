	Kosovo protesters set fire to building
</title>
<description>
	
Anti-government protesters in Kosovo's capital Pristina have clashed with police at a demonstration against an agreement with the Serb minority.
Protesters threw petrol bombs and stones. Part of a government building was set on fire, but the flames were soon extinguished.
Kosovo broke away from Serbia in 2008, a decade after a conflict between Serb forces and Kosovo Albanian rebels.
